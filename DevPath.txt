Started with Ticket/Event API.
Creating tickets and events.
Ability to parse QR code and generate one.

Big pieces.
Payment mechanism (backend setup). Strip account etc.
UI to accept that and also send it to the backend.
Also UI to accept customer info.

Notification Mechanism to customers as expanded in SendNotification.txt

--Update as of 4/28
 Need to get the event id in the application. Right now it defaults to One.
 How will event id feed to the UI? Is it through branding url?

 Get event entitlements from dn and show on UI?
