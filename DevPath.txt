Started with Ticket/Event API.
Creating tickets and events.
Ability to parse QR code and generate one.

Big pieces.
Payment mechanism (backend setup). Strip account etc.
UI to accept that and also send it to the backend.
Also UI to accept customer info.

Notification Mechanism to customers as expanded in SendNotification.txt

--Update as of 4/28
 Need to get the event id in the application. Right now it defaults to One.
 How will event id feed to the UI? Is it through branding url?

 Get event entitlements from dn and show on UI?

 --update as of 4/6
 Looked at ticketleap.customer

 Need to change the sale mechanism. Havd to generate a sales receipt for order and link it to tickets.
 So need a sale table with a confirmation ID generated.

 Need to change the url to buy tickets to include event and org. So maybe need an  org table also
 So the url would be something like https://www.ticketleap.events/tickets/polkadots/evetn-firs
