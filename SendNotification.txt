This is to plan how to send notification to customers when they purchase a ticket.
customer info received and added to DB with AddTicket call.

We would need to a notificatio table where when the ticket is added to the DB, the worker scans the notifcation 
table for tickets to send notification to and updates the record when done.
So essentially a DB queue. Notifications can be send by AWS SMS and AWS Email.

Or maybe utilize the AWS infra somehow. Where we can add the records directly to an AWS event queue.
And a subscriber can pick it up to send emails and messages. That way we are not maintaining a db queue.
For that one option is to add the SMS or email notifications to a Amazon SQS queue. And trigger a lambda to 
send emails using aWS SES or AWS SNS for texts. So 2 queues one for email and one for SMS.
The queue would need the qr code or multiple QR codes (?) for multiple users to send to. Or maybe just the text of
the QR and it can generate and send the qr if possible from Lambda (not sure since the library had a windows restriction).

Looks like message size allowed is 256 Kib and one QR file is 22 kb. So should be ok.
One issue is how to create an audit log for emails sent and sms so we can track reports and failures.
Ideally the transaction should add a log to the mysql db or we need to find out some other way.
